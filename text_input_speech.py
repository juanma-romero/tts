         "Synthesized speech can be created by concatenating pieces of "
         "recorded speech that are stored in a database. Systems differ "
         "in the size of the stored speech units; a system that stores "
         "phones or diphones provides the largest output range, but may "
         "lack clarity. For specific usage domains, the storage of entire "
         "words or sentences allows for high-quality output. Alternatively, "
         "a synthesizer can incorporate a model of the vocal tract and other "
         "human voice characteristics to create a completely synthetic voice output."
         "The quality of a speech synthesizer is judged by its similarity to "
         "the human voice and by its ability to be understood clearly. "
         "An intelligible text-to-speech program allows people with visual "
         "impairments or reading disabilities to listen to written words on "
         "a home computer. Many computer operating systems have included "
         "speech synthesizers since the early 1990s.")
